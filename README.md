# Kevin's dotfiles

## Purpose

This repository contains a copy of some of my settings files, such as:

- .bashrc (as bashrc.sh)
- .gitconfig (as gitconfig.ini)
- .ssh/config (as ssh_config)

The code is primarily for my own use, although it is possible others might find certain snippets useful.

To install into the current user's home directory, run `make install`.
