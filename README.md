# Kevin's dotfiles

## Purpose

This repository contains a copy of some of my settings files, such as:

- .bashrc (as bash/rc)
- .config/git/config (as git/config)
- .ssh/config (as ssh/config)

The code is primarily for my own use (on Debian and Ubuntu operating systems), although it is possible others might find certain snippets useful.

To install into the current user's home directory, run `make install`. Files from the repository will replace existing files. However, files that merely serve as placeholders for host-specific settings files will not replace existing files.
